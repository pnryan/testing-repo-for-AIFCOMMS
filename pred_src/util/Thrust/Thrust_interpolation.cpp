/* Herein get_CT, given that it is a very approximate analysis we are doing, I came up with a simple linear expression for C_t.
From the plot it was evident that C_t tends to be more and more linear as we....
move towards a smaller pitch/diameter ratio.
Hence I just came up with a linear equation for the situation considering two power law equations for x and y intersects...
That is I came up with two regression models for the intersections and just got the equation of the line connecting them
I thought this was better than interpolation for now. Please let me know if I should change this!
