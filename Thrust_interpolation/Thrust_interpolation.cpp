// Have to change variable names and look after proper inheritance
// We need to inherit forward velocity,rate of revolution,diameter,density in SI Units
 
/* Herein get_CT, given that it is a very approximate analysis we are doing, I came up with a simple linear expression for C_t.
     From the plot it was evident that C_t tends to be more and more linear as we.... 
     move towards a smaller pitch/diameter ratio.
     Hence I just came up with a linear equation for the situation considering two power law equations for x and y intersects...
     That is I came up with two regression models for the intersections and just got the equation of the line connecting them  
     I thought this was better than interpolation for now. Please let me know if I should change this!
